      'The *History*\'s record of the Zhou, as well as the semi-mythological history preceding its record, figure large in all of the Chinese thinkers that follow. According to this history of classical China, the first ruler was thought to be a man named Yao. Yao was named Son of Heaven by the people to rule over the "world" (China) because of his extraordinary virtue. When Yao grew old, he appointed Shun, the most virtuous man he could find, and Shun appointed Yu as his successor in a similar way. However, rather than searching for a virtuous man as his successor, Yu appointed his son and founded the Xia dynasty. The Xia dynasty and its successor, the Shang dynasty, both started out with good rulers, but each eventually deteriorated into tyranny.  Thus emerged the concept of the "Mandate of Heaven," a right to rule that a ruler could lose through despotism. When rulers lost the Mandate, they could be virtuously overthrown, as the Shang overthrew the Xia and the Zhou overthrew the Shang.',

Yet Confucius set out the terms that everyone else would redefine over and over again in the following centuries.",

Confucius' philosophy lies in the balancing of opposites: cultural refinement and peasant-like simplicity, dutifulness to one's social role and flexible sympathetic understanding. To Confucius, goodness is spontaneous and situation-specific, but rooted in rituals that come from ancient tradition.",
      "Confucius gives many examples and does not define his key terms clearly, and this is perhaps part of his elusive wisdom. Through this roundabout method, he refined many concepts from antiquity that would be heavily debated in the coming centuries. Confucius refused to let himself be called an innovator or a sage, but within a few centuries, Xunzi was calling him the greatest sage to have ever lived.",
