The Inward Training ("*Neiye*") is a text of unknown authorship, which lays out a cosmology of the Way (*dao*) and outlines a mystical practice for attaining inner power and calmness. Some, such as Harold Roth, believe it provided the basic spiritual practice that later texts, such as the Laozi, built upon, while Michael Puett frames it as a practical application of the *Laozi*. Regardless, it presents the emerging idea of the Dao as an underlying cosmic force, with which one can acknowledge and/or align oneself to their benefit.
