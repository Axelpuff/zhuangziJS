The *History*, or *Shu*, is a record of the events leading to the establishment of the Zhou dynasty. It is one of the "[Five Classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Books_and_Five_Classics#Five_Classics)" of the Confucian tradition, although it predates Confucius by hundreds of years.

The *History*'s record of the Zhou, as well as the semi-mythological history preceding its record, figure large in all of the Chinese thinkers that follow. According to this history of classical China, the first ruler was thought to be a man named Yao. Yao was named Son of Heaven by the people to rule over the "world" (China) because of his extraordinary virtue. When Yao grew old, he appointed Shun, the most virtuous man he could find, and Shun appointed Yu as his successor in a similar way. However, rather than searching for a virtuous man as his successor, Yu appointed his son and founded the Xia dynasty. The Xia dynasty and its successor, the Shang dynasty, both started out with good rulers, but each eventually deteriorated into tyranny.  Thus emerged the concept of the "Mandate of Heaven," a right to rule that a ruler could lose through despotism. When rulers lost the Mandate, they could be virtuously overthrown, as the Shang overthrew the Xia and the Zhou overthrew the Shang.

This linking of authority with personal virtue (*dé*) would become crucial in classical Chinese thought, and nearly every thinker would appeal to the *History*'s anecdotes to support their conclusions.
