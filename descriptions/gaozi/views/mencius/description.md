Mencius was a rival philosopher to Gaozi. The Gaozi passages in the *Mencius* show dialogs in which Mencius has the last word, and help to expound Mencius' philosophy about human nature and where benevolence and righteousness come from. Gaozi's claims about human nature supply metaphors (e.g. water, the willow tree) that Mencius later reworks.
