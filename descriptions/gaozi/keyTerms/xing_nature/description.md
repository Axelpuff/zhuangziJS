Gaozi views human nature as essentially malleable. It is like a tree which must be molded into cups and bowls, or water that flows where an opening is made. Human nature produces instincts like hunger; it is merely a substance that can take on the forms of righteousness and benevolence. Unlike Xunzi's view, which seems to draw on Gaozi's, human nature is ambivalent rather than distinctively bad.
