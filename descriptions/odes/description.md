The *Odes* is a collection of poetry and one of the "Five Classics" of the Confucian traidition, although it predates Confucius. The *Odes* include folk songs as well as poems about the Zhou dynasty. Appealing to the *Odes* through interpretation of its poems would become a critical tactic for Confucius, Mozi, Mencius, and later thinkers who tried to replicate them.
