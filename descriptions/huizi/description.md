Huizi, or Hui Shi, was a logician whose only surviving work is a fragment known as the "Theses". These fragments, as well as other writers' portrayals of him, suggest he was a metaphysician and logician interested in paradoxes of space and language. He influenced both Zhuangzi, likely a friend of Huizi's, who admired him but saw his efforts as ultimately futile, and Xunzi, who critiqued his single-mindedness and abuse of language.
