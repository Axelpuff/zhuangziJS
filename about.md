# About

Hundred Schools Explorer aims to capture the landscape of Classical Chinese philosophy in all its harmony and dissonance. The philosophers and texts are arranged temporally along the strings of a *Guqin*, a traditional Chinese zither that existed in the time of Confucius.

## How to use

**Scroll vertically** to move along the zither strings.

**Click on a glowing sphere** to enter that text or thinker's perspective of the philosophical landscape.

Within that view, **click on another sphere** to learn more about the place of another text within that perspective.

## Credits

In terms of interpretation, this project is deeply indebted to Michael Puett, Philip J. Ivanhoe, and Bryan W. Van Norden. Countless connections between the thinkers come from lecture, section, and the footnotes of *Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy* (Ivanhoe and Van Norden, Third ed., Hackett). The book's inclusion of more obscure philosophers (the School of Names, Yang Zhu, Shen Dao) and their influence on the major thinkers was one of two major inspirations for this project, the other being my attempts to diagram out the relationships between the thinkers during lecture.

Quotations from the *Book of Lord Shang* are from the J. J. L. Duyvendak translation, and quotations from the *Neiye* are from *Original Dao* (Harold Roth, Columbia). Quotations from all other texts are from Ivanhoe and Van Norden's *Readings*.

Finally, a hundred thanks to Professor Michael Puett, Head TF Queenie Luo, and my section TF Angela Zhang for an amazing class and an amazing semester!
