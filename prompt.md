Be concise. Help me create a project roadmap. I'm planning to do the implementation as a static site using Three.js. I found a freely available Zither model online and no other substantive 3D modeling should be involved apart from creating the materials for the orb visuals. The main milestones are:

Presentation: I want to have an impressive demo, but most of the philosophers/texts don't need to be written up yet, and a lot of sections (e.g. how different philosophers view the past) can be left out. There should be 1 or 2 philosophers with impressive visuals. 

Final submission: All the writing and per-text orb visuals should be done, along with any incomplete sections.

I'm not planning to do any animated intro anymore.

Ask about any implementation details before generating the roadmap.

The proposal is here:

"Central Theme
	My project will help its users explore how classical Chinese thinkers see one another, both explicitly (in their direct critiques) and implicitly (more subtle borrowings and adaptations). The guiding claim is that there is no neutral vantage point in the classical period: every school positions itself in relation to others. Inspired by Zhuangzi’s relativism (“There is nothing that cannot be looked at that way. / There is nothing that cannot be looked at this way. / But that is not the way I see things; / Only as I know things myself do I know them.”), the site makes visible how selecting any one philosopher re-arranges the entire field and subtly changes key ideas like dao (道), de (德), wuwei (無為), and human nature (xing 性). The goal is that the user will come away with a deeper appreciation of how philosophy can never be done in isolation.
Artistic Form
	My project will be an interactive website. Thinkers are represented by glowing orbs of different colors on a timeline resembling the strings of a zither. Some of the circles drift and blur to register chronological ambiguity (e.g. those of the History and Odes and seemingly mythological writers like Laozi).
	Clicking any thinker rearranges the others to reflect the selected thinker’s perspective. Later philosophers fade into the background, and previous ones move into opposition with the selected philosopher or one another. Key terms appear on the bottom in large Chinese characters and Pinyin with descriptions of how the thinker uses them. Authentic images (bronzes, bamboo slips, rubbings) and calligraphic fragments will provide historical texture.
	The sound design will play with the themes of harmony and dissonance between the philosophers’ ideas. The dynamism of a website is well-suited to express how terms and even thinkers can shift as the perspective changes: Mencius will position himself above the dueling followers of Mozi and Yang Zhu, who are in foolish opposition; Xunzi will rearrange all the previous thinkers into a swirling ball of extreme fixations, with Confucius balanced at the center. Instead of having one diagram from a supposedly objective perspective, or many separate diagrams for all of the philosophers, the website format allows the same elements to be put together in many different ways.
Philosophical Texts and Ideas
	The site will briefly cover most of the philosophers covered in the course, including some others featured in the textbook. However, the organizing principle of the project is Zhuangzi’s critique of hard distinctions and how the same thing can be seen in many different ways.
	The major figures will be Confucius (as the Analects), Mozi, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Xunzi, Lord Shang, and Han Feizi,
	The minor figures will be the sage kings (as the History and Odes), Yang Zhu, Huizi and Gonsun Longzi, Gaozi, the Nei-yeh, and Shen Dao, who will be mentioned mainly in relation to their respective major figures.
Message
	The main message is, of course, that philosophy is relative and every thinker needs to base their claims on ideas and people that came before them. The Chinese classical philosophers, with their diametric opposites and keen observations of these opposites, illustrate this beautifully. However, I hope the project will also express that these ideas maintain their value, even in spite of the impossibility of finding absolute truth and unanimous agreement. This goal is in line with Zhuangzi’s mission to put distinctions in their place (not destroy them).
	I also aim to bring various pieces of literature on the outskirts of classical philosophy into the conversation, which are typically not considered part of the philosophical canon but which exercised outsized influence upon it. In particular, I want users to understand the massive importance of the Odes and History, and the impact of the School of Names (Huizi and Gongsun Longzi) on Daoismn (and maybe even later developments). Huizi may have not made any surviving claims about how to structure society, but the paradoxes he expressed perhaps had an impact on the legalists when they decided to keep things practical and away from the abstract."

My original ideas are here:
"– Timeline with glowing circles representing thinkers / ways of living
	- Like notes on staff lines that are like Zither strings
	- beautiful sound design – harmony and dissonance between different philosophers
– Mingjia, Zhou dynasty, Yao & Shun, Yang Zhu
– Drift around / blur to indicate time ambiguity
– Click on one and the others rearrange into a view of how that one philosopher saw the others with explanations
– Uses Chinese characters & authentic images to capture the real vibe
	- Each circle also has explanations of the unique ways the thinkers see certain key words or concepts (dao/way, de/virtue, etc.)

Other ideas
- Long narrated animated intro about Yao, Shun, etc. at the beginning
- History and Odes circles as a proxy for the Zhou and previous history
- Confucius/Kongzi:
- “Confucius was the most important figure in the classical period. Every thinker who came afterwards can be roughly sorted into those who sought to imitate him (the Confucians), those who opposed him (the Mohists), and those who thought they could transcend him (the Daoists).”
- Epigram: “I can look at it this way, I can look at it that way, But the only way I see them is how I see them.”  - Zhuangzi (rough paraphrase)

Colors:
- Daoists: Blue, legalists: Gold (Han imperial color), Confucians: vermillion (as opposed to purple), Yang Zhu: Green (natural), Mingjia: white (hard & white), Mohists: orange? (leftover color)

Xunzi's triad resembles the triad at the beginning of the Inward Training (Heaven, earth, human beings).

Presentation is not the final due date

Focus on making it attractive visually (form), not having all of the thinkers in there (content)
This could be a broader project for my entire life (sections for other regions and eras, all interconnected)

[Gened final project proposal](:/e75d75714f92406184e2f675cfc1e21c)

This interactive website provides an elegant 3D visual of how classical Chinese thinkers borrowed from and critiqued one another, helping users appreciate how no idea can exist in a vacuum.

**Time expectation: 15 hours**!!!!! INCLUDING WRITEUP!!!! IMPORTANT!!!! **MUST NOT EXCEED THIS**

11/22
- A section for each thinker on how they view **antiquity** (sage-kings, people building nests, etc.) (low priority)
- A section for how each thinker views a sage ("outside the floating dust" for Zhuangzi) (low priority)
- A quote for each thinker within a thinker's purview
	- (for Zhuangzi "Mohists and Confucians right each other's wrongs", "This would make Huang Di's ears ring. How could Kongzi understand it?", "Master Bright Works playing his lute, Huizi leaning at his desk-- these all [were masters of their work/separated this and that?]")
- Kongzi/Confucius' diagram only shows the History and Odes. Main quote: "I do not innovate, I merely transmit."
	- Main terms: Wuwei, Gentleman?, Dao, De/virtue
- Logos for each thinker instead of just monograms (low priority)
	- Square for Han Feizi
	- Wheel for Xunzi
	- Spring/water for Kongzi
	- Sprout for Mengzi
	- Butterfly/gourd for Zhuangzi
	- Dao symbol for Laozi?"
